    """Configure root logging for one harness process.

    Level comes from ``ZENITH_LOG_LEVEL``; when that is unset but
    ``ZENITH_LOG_FILE`` is set, the level defaults to ``INFO`` (asking for a
    log file implies wanting content in it). Otherwise the default stays
    ``WARNING`` so normal operation is quiet.

    Logs always go to stderr. When ``ZENITH_LOG_FILE`` holds a path, a
    ``FileHandler`` is added as well. This matters because Zenith runs as an
    MCP server under a host agent that owns stderr — Claude Code drops the
    harness's stderr rather than surfacing it — so the file is the only
    durable Zenith log.

    Worker and terminal-reviewer subprocesses inherit ``ZENITH_LOG_FILE`` and
    append to the same path, so every record is tagged ``[mode:pid]`` to keep
    the shared file readable as one mission timeline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode
        Harness mode of this process: ``orchestrator``, ``worker``, or
        ``terminal-reviewer``. Used only as a log-line tag.
