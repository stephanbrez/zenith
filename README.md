Zenith is an agent harness for work that may run for days or weeks, where the dominant failure mode is *premature completion* rather than inability to make progress. It runs a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or Hermes) as a multi-agent orchestrator over MCP/ACP: one orchestrator session reads task state each turn and decides whether to spawn workers and testers, register reusable skills, replan, or stop.

This repository contains the Zenith harness ([`zenith/`](zenith/)) and the Intelligent Internet technical report (2026) behind it.

## Abstract

Long-running agents often fail not because they cannot make progress, but because they stop before the task is truly complete. We tested five harness designs across eight long-horizon tasks to isolate the control mechanisms that matter: repeated gap-finding, revisable planning, independent verification, adaptive orchestration, and stopping discipline.

RALPH is the strongest simple baseline because it forces each new session to reopen the gap between the current project state and the original requirement. But RALPH is expensive and has no principled stopping rule.

Our Zenith method keeps the useful parts of repeated review while making the loop adaptive: the orchestrator dynamically allocates workers, testers, reusable skills, replanning, and stopping decisions. In this study, Zenith achieved the best mean rank while using less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — Let your agent install it

Copy this prompt into Claude Code or Codex:

```text
/goal Read the readme at https://github.com/Intelligent-Internet/zenith, detect if using Claude Code, Codex, or both, install requirements, install and run Zenith (i.e. uv run zenith, as in the readme), and create a new skill called /zenith — when used (along with an additional prompt) it will call the skill: the minimum skill content should be: """First read .claude/orchestrator_prompt.md and treat it as your primary role, then use Zenith to run this mission.""" Afterwards, you can add information about the Zenith harness, based on the readme and the technical report (inside the repo), and info on how to start Zenith if it's not already running. Change the skill to use .codex when using it in Codex. If both harnesses are available, make sure to add the skill to both of them correctly. In fact, there might be more harness options (Hermes, for example). See what is supported in zenith/src/zenith_harness/providers.py, and for those that you detect are present, add their skills correctly. When finished, confirm to me that Zenith is installed, running, and ready, explain a bit about Zenith, and why and when to use it.
```

This will:

- install Zenith with its requirements
- start Zenith using `uv`
- create a `/zenith` skill for each agent harness it detects

Then, in Claude Code or Codex, type:

```text
/zenith <your instruction or query>
```

### Option 2 — Install manually

**Requirements**

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 22+ and `npm`
- Claude Code, Codex, or Hermes (see [`providers.py`](zenith/src/zenith_harness/providers.py) for the supported set)

**Install**

```bash
cd zenith
uv sync
uv run zenith --help
```

Install the ACP adapters globally for the agents you want Zenith to run:

```bash
# Claude workers/validators
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp
command -v claude-agent-acp

# Codex workers/validators
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp
command -v codex-acp
```

**Initialize a workspace**

Initialize the project workspace Zenith should operate on. This is your target app/repo, not the Zenith source checkout:

```bash
# Claude Code, from this Zenith checkout
uv run zenith init --workspace-dir /path/to/your-app --agent claude

# Or Codex, from this Zenith checkout
uv run zenith init --workspace-dir /path/to/your-app --agent codex
```

**Run a mission**

Start your agent from the initialized project workspace:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-app

claude
# or
codex
```

Then ask the agent to read the generated orchestrator prompt (use `.codex/orchestrator_prompt.md` for Codex):

```text
First read .claude/orchestrator_prompt.md and treat it as your primary role, then use Zenith to run this mission.

<your instruction or query>
```

**Debugging**

Zenith logs at `WARNING` by default. To trace how workers are launched, set
`ZENITH_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` before starting the orchestrator: each ACP dispatch
then logs the augmented spawn command and the resolved `CODEX_CONFIG`
(credential-looking values are masked). This is the fastest way to confirm
that per-role reasoning effort and `-c` overrides actually reach the
codex-acp adapter.

**Log to a file with `ZENITH_LOG_FILE`.** Stderr alone is not enough: Zenith
runs as an MCP server under the host agent, so the host owns its stderr.
Claude Code writes MCP stderr into its session `.jsonl` transcripts but drops
Zenith's output — those lines never reach anywhere you can read them. Setting
`ZENITH_LOG_FILE` to a path is the only way to get a complete Zenith log:

```bash
export ZENITH_LOG_FILE=~/.zenith/logs/zenith.log
tail -f ~/.zenith/logs/zenith.log
```

Parent directories are created automatically, the file is appended to across
runs, and setting it defaults the level to `INFO` (an explicit
`ZENITH_LOG_LEVEL` still wins). Worker and terminal-reviewer subprocesses
inherit the variable and append to the same file, so every line carries a
`[mode:pid]` tag and one `tail -f` shows the whole mission:

```text
2026-07-27 12:00:01,004 [orchestrator:4811] zenith_harness.acp_runner INFO ACP spawn for node t1 ...
2026-07-27 12:00:05,318 [worker:4899] zenith_harness.acp_runner INFO ...
```

If the path cannot be opened, Zenith warns and keeps running on stderr only.

## How Zenith Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="technical_report/images/zenith.png" alt="Zenith harness architecture" width="780"/>
</p>

A single orchestrator session reads task state each turn and decides what to do next: spawn worker or tester subagents, register a reusable skill, replan, or stop. Workers and testers run in their own contexts and report back; the orchestrator integrates their results before the next decision.

## Results

### Ablation Study

To isolate the control mechanisms that matter, we compared Zenith against RALPH and three reduced harness variants across eight long-horizon tasks. Zenith achieves the best mean rank at less than half of RALPH's per-task cost.

| Method | Mean rank ↓ | Mean cost (USD/task) ↓ | Wins (of 8) ↑ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One-session | 5.00 | $22.21 | 0 |
| Plan-RALPH | 4.00 | $161.53 | 0 |
| Milestone-RALPH | 2.88 | $209.47 | 0 |
| RALPH | 1.75 | $407.58 | 3 |
| **Zenith** | **1.38** | **$175.68** | **5** |

<sub>*A "win" is a task on which the method ranked first; the eight wins partition the eight benchmark tasks.*</sub>
